To enable the connection between the Rokoko desktop and the control laptop:

In the Rokoko Desktop: 
- Use the existing wireless card to connect to eduroam (via Wi-Fi)
- Use the ethernet port to connect to SINLab Hotspot (router). 
- Once both are connected, edit the routing rules; Type route print and delete the default wireless interface routing rule (i.e., route delete 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 192.168.50.1). It is likely that the rule comes up again. To avoid that, consider a script.

In the control laptop:
- Connect to 5G using the ZTE modem (bridge mode)
- Use the ethernet port to connect to the Ubiquiti switch. This connection is used for the communnication with the UR10e.
- Once both are connected, edit the routing rules;  Type ip route and delete the default ethernet interface routing rule (e.g., sudo route del -net 0.0.0.0 gw 192.168.1.1) 

To enable the tunneling between the control laptop and NREC, run the script on the control laptop ./live-tunnel-tmux-setup.sh . This opens up two screens.
